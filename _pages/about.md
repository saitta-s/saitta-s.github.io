##### **Research Vision**
Biomedical applications are the focus of my research. Motivated by solving real-world problems, I enjoy blending influences and methods from various fields, mainly machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, image analysis, and computational geometry.

##### **Short Bio**
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href='https://www.biomech.polimi.it/'>Biomechanics Group</a> at <a href='https://www.polimi.it/'>Politecnico di Milano</a>, Milan, Italy. In May 2023 I obtained my PhD (_cum Laude_) in Bioengineering with a thesis focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches for anatomical and hemodynamic analysis from medical imaging. My research combines biomedical image analysis and simulation, with the aim of developing data-driven solutions to clinical problems. Some of my favorite techniques include convolutional neural networks for 3D medical image segmentation, implicit neural representations for fluid flow measurement denoising and super-resolution, and automatic pipelines for surgical pre-procedural planning. During my PhD, I was a visiting student in the <a href='http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis'>Cambridge Image Analysis Group</a> at the <a href='https://www.cam.ac.uk/'>University of Cambridge</a>. Throughout my PhD I also worked on multiple other projects related to computational fluid dynamics and medical image processing that led to scientific publications.


Prior to this, I spent some time with the <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/biofluids-and-transport/'>Biofluids and Transport Group</a> at <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/'>Imperial College London</a> where I worked on my <a href='https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/140376'>MSc thesis</a> and later as a Research Assistant. During this time I built a <a href='https://github.com/saitta-s/flow4D'>small piece of software</a> for analyzing 4D flow MR images.
I also worked as a Research Engineer in the Cardiovascular Biomechanics and Ultrasound Laboratory at the <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/'>National University of Singapore</a> where I focused on simulation and registration of 4D fetal heart echocardiographic images.
